# Space and the World Beyond
You land on a colorful planet, looking to bring resources back home. How will you traverse this unexplored land?


## Inspiration
We liked space. We like games. Space game. Simple.
## What it does
This game is a 3rd person shooter, a collection game, and an exploration game.
## How we built it
We used Unity3D, Blender, and C#.
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was GitHub and merge conflicts due to gitignore not working. Some other issues were merging character controls and the camera. There were also challenges deciding on the general design of the project. We also didn't finish all the features we wanted to implement. Lastly, sleep was also a big issue.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting gitignore to work!! Additionally, creating a nice color scheme that meshes well with the tone of the game. We are also proud to use some of our own Blender assets. 
## What we learned
Put gitignore in the right folder as well as setting up 3rd person environment and control. 
## What's next for Space and the World Beyond
More features, more planets, next levels, more survival aspect, more diverse enemies. Increase difficulty, additional resources to collect.
